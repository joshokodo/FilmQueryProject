#### Lessons Learned
- Learning how to properly use mysql and having the correct prepared statements was the most difficult part.

#### Problems/Issues
- I found the logic of my program was not working with making my connections to the DataBase a field of the class, so I changed them to local variables for each relevant method.
 


#### Stretch Goals
- I wanted to add the ability to delete or edit a film but it was not a requirement, so i focused on generally being able to connect to the database
